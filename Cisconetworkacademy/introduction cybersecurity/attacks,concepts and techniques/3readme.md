# Hardware vulnerabilities 
Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws

for example  RAM 
- meltdown and spectre
Google security researchers discovered Meltdown and Spectre, two hardware vulnerabilities that affect almost all central processing units (CPUs) released
since 1995 within desktops, laptops, servers, smartphones, smart devices and cloud services

# Software vulnerabilities 
Software vulnerabilities are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application code

## categorizing  software vulnerabilities
- Buffer overflow  - Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. A vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer.
- Non-validated input  -  Programs often require data input, but this incoming data could have malicious content, designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way
- Race conditions  -  This vulnerability describes a situation where the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs. A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order or at the proper time
- Weakesses in security practices  -  Systems and sensitive data can be protected through techniques such as authentication, authorization and encryption. Developers should stick to using security techniques and libraries that have already been created, tested and verified and should not attempt to create their own security algorithms. These will only likely introduce new vulnerabilities
- Access control problems  -  Access control is the process of controlling who does what and ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resource, such as a file, and what they can do with it, such as read or change the file

 # software updating 
 The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities
