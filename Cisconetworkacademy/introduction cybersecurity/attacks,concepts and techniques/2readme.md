# Social engineering 
- pretexting  - this is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data
- tailgating  - this is when an attacker quickly follows an authorized person into a secure, physical location
- something for something (quid pro quo)  -  this is when an attacker requests personal information from a person in exchange for something, like a free gift
# Deniel-of-service 
- Overwhelming quantity of traffic
- Maliciously formatted packets
# Botnet 
- Infected bots try to communicate with a command and conftrol host on the internet
- botnet filter is a feature that detects traffic coming from devices infected with the malicious botnet code
- SIO service puches down updated filters to the firewall that match traffic from new known botnets
- internal security team to notify them about the infected devices that are generating malicious traffic so that they can prevent mitigate and remedy these
 
# On-Path attacks 
On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices
- man in the middle - a MITM attack happens when of a device without the user's knowledge.With this level of access, and attacker can intercept and capture user information before it is sent to its intended destination. these types of attackd are often used to steal financial information
- man in the mobile - a variation of man in middle MITMO is a type of attack used to take control over a user's mobile device. When infected, the mobile device is instucted to exfiltrate user sensitive information and send it to the attackers.
# SEO poisoning 
the most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or attempt social engineering 

#Password attacks 
- password spraying - this technique attempts to gain access to a system by ‘spraying’ a few commonly used passwords across a large number of accounts
- dictionary attacks - a hacker systematically tries every word in a dictionary or a list of commonly used words as a password in an attempt to break into a password-protected account
- brute-force attacks - the simplest and most commonly used way of gaining access to a password-protected site, brute-force attacks see an attacker using all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols in the password space until they get it right
- rainbow attacks - Passwords in a computer system are not stored as plain text, but as hashed values (numerical values that uniquely identify data). A rainbow table is a large dictionary of precomputed hashes and the passwords from which they were calculated
- traffic interception - If you store a password in clear, readable text, anyone who has access to your account or device, whether authorized or unauthorized, can read it

# advanced persistent threats 
Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs
