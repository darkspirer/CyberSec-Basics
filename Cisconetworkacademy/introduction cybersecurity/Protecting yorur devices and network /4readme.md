# Safeguarding your online privacy 
- two factor authentication

Any platform or website where you have an online account requires two-factor authentication from you, meaning 
they may ask for your password along with a fingerprint, phone number,
email, or Face ID

# Open authorization 
This is an open authentication method that allows us to log in via another account such 
as Google or Facebook when we forget our login details for a website or platform

# Email and Web browser privacy 
- Microsoft internet explorer :imprivate
- Google chrome:incognito
- Mozilla firefox:private and tab or private window
- Safari : private browsing

When private mode is enabled, cookies - files saved to your device to indicate what websites you have 
visited - are disabled. Therefore, any temporary internet files are removed and your browsing history is 
deleted when you close the window or program. This may help to prevent others from gathering information 
about your online activities and trying to entice you to buy something with targeted ads.


Even with private browsing enabled and cookies disabled, companies are constantly developing new ways 
of fingerprinting users in order to track their online behavior.
