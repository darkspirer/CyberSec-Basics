# Cybersecurity devices and technologies
## Securiy appliances 
- Routers - while routers are primarily esed to interconnect various network segments together, they usually also provide basic traffic filtering
capabilities. This information can help you define which computers from a given network segment can communicate with which network segments.
- Firewalls - can look deeper into the network traffic itself and identify malicious behavior that has to be blocked.
Firewalls can have sophisticated security policies applied to the traffic that is passing through them. 
- Intrusion prevention systems - IPS sytems use a set of traffic signatures that match and block malicious traffic and attacks.
- Virtual private networks - VPN su=ystems let remote employees use a secure encrypted tunnel from their mobile computer and securely
connect back to the organization's network.VPN systems can also securely interconnect branch offices with the central network.
- Antimalware or antivirus - These systems use signatures or behaviofral analysis ad block malicious code from being executed.
- Oteher security devices - include web and email security appliances, ddecrytion devices, client access contrl servers adn security management systems.
## Firewalls
In computer networking, a firewall is designed to control or filter which communications are allowed in and which are allowed out of a device or network.
A firewall can be installed on a single computer with the purpose of protecting that one computer (host-based firewall) or it can be a standalone network
device that protects an entire network of computers and all of the host devices on that network (network-based firewall).


- Network layer firewall - This filters communications based on source and destination IP addresses.
- Transport layer firewall - Filters communications based on source and destination data ports, as well as connection states.
- Application layer firewall - Filters communications based on an application, program or service.
- Context aware layer firewall -Filters communications based on the user, device, role, application type and threat profile.
- Proxy server - Filters web content requests like URLs, domain names and media types.
- Reverse proxy server - Placed in front of web servers, reverse proxy servers protect, hide, offload and distribute access to web servers.
- Network address translation (NAT) firewall - This firewall hides or masquerades the private addresses of network hosts.
- Host-based firewall - Filters ports and system service calls on a single computer operating system.

## Port scanning
 Port scanning is a process of probing a computer, server or other network host for open ports.

 ##  Intrusion detection and prevention systems

- IDS - can either be a dedicated network device or one of several tools in a server, firewall or even a host computer operating system,
such as Windows or Linux, that scans data against a database of rules or attack signatures, loking
for malicious traffic.
- IPS can block or deny traffic based on a positive rule or signature match. One of the most well-known
IPS/IDS systems is Snort.
