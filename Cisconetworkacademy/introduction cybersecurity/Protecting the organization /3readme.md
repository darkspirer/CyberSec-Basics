# Cisco's approach to cybersecurity
## Cisco's  CSIRT
Many large organizations have a Computer Security Incident Response Team
(CSIRT) to receive, review and respond to computer security incident reports.
## Security playbook 
One of the best ways to prepare for a security breach is to prevent it. Organizations should provide guidance on:

- how to identify the cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities
- the implementation of safeguards and personnel training
- a flexible response plan that minimizes the impact and damage in the event of a security breach
- security measures and processes that need to be put in place in the aftermath of a security breach.

A security playbook is a collection of repeatable queries or reports that outline a standardized process 
for incident detection and response.Ideally a security playbook should:
- highlight how to identify and automate the response to common threats such as the detection of malware-infected machines,
suspicious network activity or irregulat authentication attempts.
- describe and clearly define inbound and outboumd traffic.
- provide summary information includeing trends, statistics and count.
- provide usable and quick access to key statistics and metrics.
- correlate events across all relevant data sources.

# Tools for incident detection and prevention 
A security information and Event Management (SIEM) system collects and analyzes security alerts, logs and 
other real-time and historical data from security devices on the network to facilitate early detection of cyber attacks.



A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system is designed to stop sensitive data from or escaping a network.
It monitors and protects data in three different states: data in use, data in motion and data rest.
