# Behavior approach to cybersecrity 
## Behavior based security 
Behavior-based security is a form of threat detection that involves capturing
and analyzing the flow of communication between a user on the local network and a local
or remote destination. Any changes in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies and
may indicate an attack.

- Honeypots - a honeypots is behavior-based detection tool that lures the attacker in by appealing to their predicted
pattern of malicious behavior. Once the attacker is inside the honypot, the network administrator can 
capture, log and analyze their behavior so that they can build a better defense.

- Cisco's Cyber Threat defense solution architecture  -  This security architecture uses behavior based
detection and indicators to provide greater visibility, context and control. The aim is to know who is
carrying out the attack, what type of attack they are performing and where, when and how the attack is 
taking place. This security architecture ises many security techmologies to achieve this goal.

## Netflow 
NetFlow technology is used to gather information about data flowing through a network, including
who and what devices are in the network, and when and how users and devices access the network.

## Penetration testing 
penetration testing, commonly known as pen testing, is the aact of assessing a computer  system, network
or organization for security vulnerabilities.

- Planning - The pen tester gathers as much information as possible about a target system or network,
its potential vulnerabilities and exploits to use against it. This involves conducting passive or active
reconnaissance (footprinting) and vulnerability research.
- Scanning - The pen tester carries out active reconnaissance to probe a target system or network and identify
 potential weaknesses which, if exploited, could give an attacker access. Active reconnaissance may include:

port scanning to identify potential access points into a target system
vulnerability scanning to identify potential exploitable vulnerabilities of a particular target
establishing an active connection to a target (enumeration) to identify the user account, system account and admin account.

- Gaining access - The pen tester will attempt to gain access to a target system and sniff network traffic, using various methods to exploit the system including:

launching an exploit with a payload onto the system
breaching physical barriers to assets
social engineering
exploiting website vulnerabilities
exploiting software and hardware vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
breaching access controls security
cracking weak encrypted Wi-Fi.

- Maintaining access - The pen tester will maintain access to the target to find out what data and systems are vulnerable to exploitation. It is important that they remain undetected, typically using backdoors, Trojan horses, rootkits and other covert channels to hide their presence.

When this infrastructure is in place, the pen tester will then proceed to gather the data that they consider valuable.


- Analysis and reporting - The pen tester will maintain access to the target to find out what data and systems are vulnerable to exploitation. It is important that they remain undetected, typically using backdoors, Trojan horses, rootkits and other covert channels to hide their presence.

When this infrastructure is in place, the pen tester will then proceed to gather the data that they consider valuable.


## Impact reduction 

- Communicate the issue
- Be sincere and accountable
- Provide the details
- Find the cause
- Apply lessons learned
- Check, and check again
- Edacate

## Risk management
Risk management is the formal process of continuosly identifying and assessing risk in an effort to reduce the impact of threats and vulnerabilities.

- Frame the risk - Identify the threats that increase risk. Threats may include processes, products, attacks, potential
failure or disruption of servides, negative perception of an organization's reputation,
potentioal legal liability or loss of intellectual property.
- Assess the risk - Determine the severity that each threat poses. For example, some threats may have the potential to bring an entire organizaion to a standstill, while other
threats may be only minor inconveniences. Risk can be prioritized by assessing financial impacy(a quantitative analyziz ) or scaled impact on an organization's operation (a qualitative analysis ).
- Respond to the risk - Develop an action plan to reduce overall organization risk exposure, detailing where risk can be eliminated, mitigated, transferred or accepted.
- Monitor the risk - Continously review any risk reduced through elimnation, mitigation or transfer actions.Remember, not all risks can be eliminated, so you will need to closely monitor any threats that have been accepted.
