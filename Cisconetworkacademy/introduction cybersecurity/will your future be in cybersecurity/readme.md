# Legal and ethical issues 
## Legal issues in cybersecurity 
- Personal legal issues - At work or home, you may have the opportunity and skiils to hack another person's computer or network. But there is an old saying"Just because you can does not mean you should" Most hacks leave tracks which can be traced back to you.
- Corporate legal issues - Most countries  have cybersecurity laws in place, which businesses and organizations must abide by.
- Inrernational law and cybersecurity - International cybersecurity law is a constantly evolving field. Cyber attacks take place in cyberspace, an electronic space created, maintained and owned by both the public and private entities. There are no traditional geographic boundaries in cyberspace. To further complicate issues, it is much easier to mask the source of a attack in cyberwarfare than in conventional warfare.
