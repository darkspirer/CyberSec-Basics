# what was taken
Nowadays, cybercrimes have increased significantly, and the main motivation behind them is money. Criminals hack insecure websites and platforms
to steal data, or they obtain personal information through phishing attacks.
This stolen information is mainly used to withdraw money or take out loans in someone else’s name. Such cases are happening very frequently,
especially in Uzbekistan. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid sharing our personal information with anyone and to stay away from unsafe websites.
