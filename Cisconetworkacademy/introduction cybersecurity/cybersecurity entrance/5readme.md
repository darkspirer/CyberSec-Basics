# Cyberwarfare
- Stuxnet  -  Stuxnet was a highly sophisticated and specially designed piece of malware created to attack industrial control systems. It was discovered in 2010 and is considered one of the most famous cyberattacks in history.

The main target of Stuxnet was Iran’s uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. This facility used computer-controlled industrial equipment, including centrifuges for enriching uranium.

How Stuxnet worked:

It initially spread through infected USB flash drives.

It exploited several “zero-day” vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows.

It infiltrated the facility’s SCADA system (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), which controls industrial machinery.

It manipulated the centrifuges by making them spin faster or slower than normal, eventually damaging them.

At the same time, it sent fake data to the operators so that everything appeared to be working normally.

As a result, Stuxnet damaged thousands of centrifuges and significantly slowed down Iran’s nuclear program.

Many cybersecurity experts believe that Stuxnet was developed by the United States and Israel, although this has never been officially confirmed.

This incident is often considered the beginning of the modern era of cyberwarfare.
